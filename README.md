# Credit Flow System – Process Flowchart
This repository contains a Credit Flow System process flowchart, illustrating the step-by-step workflow for credit approval in a business. It visually represents the interactions between Sales, Customer Management, and the Credit Department to ensure proper credit validation before approving a sale.

**Process Overview:**

**Sales Call & Order Entry** – A customer places an order.

**Customer & Credit Validation** – The order form and credit form are submitted. The Credit Department checks customer eligibility based on predefined criteria.

**Credit Check & Approval** – If the customer's accounts receivable balance is within limits, the credit terms are calculated and approved. If the balance is high, further checks are performed. If the customer has bad credit, the sale is not approved.

**Final Decision** –
Approved sales proceed with credit issuance.
Rejected sales are not processed.

**Use Case:** This credit flow process helps businesses maintain financial discipline, manage risk, and ensure creditworthiness before processing sales.
